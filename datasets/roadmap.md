## Data Collection:
Obtain the following datasets:
- **QASPER**: A dataset with 5,049 questions across 1,585 NLP papers.
- **NarrativeQA**: A dataset containing stories and questions.
- **QuALITY**: A dataset with multiple-choice questions based on medium-length passages.

Ensure you have access to the full text of the papers and stories in these datasets.

## Preprocessing:
- Tokenize the text data.
- Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

## Model Training:
- Train the RAPTOR model using the tree structure and the language model of your choice (e.g., GPT-4).
- Fine-tune the model on the training data.

## Evaluation:
- Evaluate the model on the validation and test sets using metrics like F1 score, BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR.
- Compare the performance of RAPTOR with other retrieval methods (e.g., BM25, DPR).

## State-of-the-Art Comparison:
- Compare RAPTORâ€™s performance with state-of-the-art models (e.g., CoLT5 XL) on the QASPER dataset.

## Results Replication:
- Use the same evaluation scripts and metrics as the original benchmark.
- Ensure that your results match or closely align with the reported benchmark results.
